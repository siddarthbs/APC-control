# APC-control

This project is about developing a novel robotic arm. It uses a flexible plastic ribbon with interlocking teeth on both edges as the basis of a new kind of linear actuator. As the ribbon is zipped into itself in a spiral, it forms a tube that can extend in a straight line, then retract into a compact, flat coil. Mounted on a gimbal and controlled with guide wires, the zipper arm could push and pull in multiple directions with a strength that belies its minimal weight and complexity. This arm can achieve an extension ratio of 12:1 and remain very lightweight. The mechanism to drive the zipper uses only one servo motor. The tube shape that the band forms is one of the best in terms of strength-to-weight ratio in supporting the compressive loads that the spiral zipper would see when mounted on a gimbal with guide wires.
